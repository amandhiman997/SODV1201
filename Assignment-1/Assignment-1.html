        <h1>About Me </h1>
        

       <p> 
        I am from a small town in India, now residing in Canada. In my
        childhood days I always wanted to be a <strong>Pilot </strong> in the
        <em>Indian Airforce</em>. Fighter Jets and the disciplined lifestyle
        of a person in the armed forces always fascinates me. As I grew up my
        passion towards the fighter jets grew more. I am currently persuing a
        Diploma in Software Development. I aimed to be a front-end developer
        and to serve my nation. To become a fighter pilot is always my
        foremost aim.
